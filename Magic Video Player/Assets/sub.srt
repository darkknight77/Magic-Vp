You know what Red John's
trying to do, don't you?

3
00:00:05,243 --> 00:00:07,243
He asked me
if I'm ready to quit.

4
00:00:07,245 --> 00:00:09,963
- How does Jane seem to you?
- I think he's in trouble.

5
00:00:09,965 --> 00:00:11,831
You tortured the guy,
for Christ sakes.

6
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:15,135
I gave an evil psychopath
justice.

7
00:00:15,137 --> 00:00:16,302
I'm not gonna apologize.

8
00:00:16,304 --> 00:00:19,806
You're fired.
Get outta here right now.

Don't do anything rash.
We can work this out.

Tough business.

I'm not a magician, no.

You do coin tricks

What is the look?

27
00:01:33,381 --> 00:01:35,632
Like you're hiding stuff.

00:01:35,634 --> 00:01:37,500
I've seen you around,

29

Uh, Lorelei, right?

31
00:01:42,524 --> 00:01:44,808
How you doing?
I'm--I'm Patrick.

32
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:47,844
Hey, Patrick.
So you're not a magician?

33
00:01:47,846 --> 00:01:51,898
No. No, I'm a con man.
I steal from people.

34
00:01:52,983 --> 00:01:54,868
(Gasps) Wow.

35
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,870
You just come right out
and say it--

36
00:01:56,872 --> 00:02:00,206
"I steal from people"--
like, "I sell shoes,"

37
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:01,324
like it's not a big deal.

38
00:02:01,326 --> 00:02:02,659
Well, it's not a big deal.

39
00:02:02,661 --> 00:02:04,461
If you know what you're doing,
it's very easy.

40
00:02:04,463 --> 00:02:08,882
It's a big deal because
it's wrong to steal from people.

41
00:02:08,884 --> 00:02:11,534
No such thing as wrong.

42
00:02:11,536 --> 00:02:13,303
Really? When did that happen?

43
00:02:13,305 --> 00:02:16,589
Well,
there's legal or illegal,

44
00:02:16,591 --> 00:02:18,424
there's, uh...

45
00:02:18,426 --> 00:02:23,513
happy or sad, rich or poor,
alive or dead,

46

no wrong or right.

One damn thing after another.

48
00:02:29,905 --> 00:02:33,456
Of course there's wrong
or right. You know that.

49
00:02:35,943 --> 00:02:38,528
I killed a man last year.

50
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:41,498
Turns out he wasn't a man
I wanted to kill. Wrong guy.

51
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,032
Anyway...

52
00:02:43,034 --> 00:02:47,570
now when I recall
shooting him dead...

53
00:02:47,572 --> 00:02:49,572
still feels good.

54
00:02:50,508 --> 00:02:53,009
It's a happy little memory
to cherish,

55
00:02:53,011 --> 00:02:55,512

here. Cognac for me.

76
00:03:38,423 --> 00:03:39,589
Mm.

77
00:03:39,591 --> 00:03:41,758
This man can reach
beyond the veil of death.

78
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,926
Did you know that?

79
00:03:42,928 --> 00:03:46,128
Uh, no. No, we--
we just met, really.

80
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,981
You ever lose someone?

81
00:03:47,983 --> 00:03:51,300
I lost my mother when I was 5.
(Clears throat)

82
00:03:51,302 --> 00:03:55,405
But this man...
he let me talk to her,

83
00:03:55,407 --> 00:03:57,857
and I truly felt
her presence.

84
00:03:57,859 --> 00:04:01,110
She said she loves me.
She's always watching over me.

85
00:04:01,112 --> 00:04:02,478
(Pats back)

86
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,479
Wow.

87
00:04:03,481 --> 00:04:06,082
Well, it's both
a gift and a curse.

88
00:04:06,084 --> 00:04:08,835
Yeah, well...
(Slurps, smacks lips)

89
00:04:08,837 --> 00:04:11,754
I told my father
all about you...

90
00:04:11,756 --> 00:04:15,658
about, uh, what an awesome
spiritual experience it was...

91
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:16,542
Mm-hmm.

92
00:04:16,544 --> 00:04:18,344
Best 10 grand
I ever spent.

93
00:04:18,346 --> 00:04:22,098
My father--he's a tight bastard.
He says, "10 grand?!

94
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,550
Screw that bitch.
Go get your money back""

95

96
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,503

my mother's not dead.

97
00:04:27,505 --> 00:04:29,856
She ran off with
her aerobics instructor.

98
00:04:29,858 --> 00:04:34,277
She lives in San Juan,
Puerto Rico. Owns a nail salon.

99
00:04:35,396 --> 00:04:38,347
That explains why she was
so easy to contact, I guess.

That's good
you can smile about this.

103
00:04:43,872 --> 00:04:44,871
Here's the thing--

104
00:04:44,873 --> 00:04:45,822
I'm gonna be forgiving.

105
00:04:45,824 --> 00:04:48,057
Give me my money back,
and, uh,

106
00:04:48,059 --> 00:04:50,827
Mervin here is gonna tune you up
a little, that's all.

107
00:04:50,829 --> 00:04:54,297
You, uh... (Sighs)
you mind if I, um...

108
00:04:54,299 --> 00:04:56,365
Give me my money back.

109
00:04:56,367 --> 00:05:01,203
Yeah, um, can I--pass a light.
Um, I don't have it.

110
00:05:01,205 --> 00:05:03,506
I spent it all.

111
00:05:03,508 --> 00:05:05,541
Okay.

112
00:05:05,543 --> 00:05:09,562
Well, Mervin's gonna break
your arms and the legs...

113
00:05:09,564 --> 00:05:13,382

again, you'll owe me 50 grand.

No hurry. Hey.

152
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,578
Sorry about Jane, by the way.
That's too bad.

153
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,629
Too bad about what?

154
00:07:43,631 --> 00:07:45,498
That he got arrested.

155
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,333
I heard it from some guys
in vice.

156
00:07:47,335 --> 00:07:51,003
He got busted for assault,
fraud, narcotics,

157
00:07:51,005 --> 00:07:53,506
and resisting arrest
in Vegas.

158
00:07:53,508 --> 00:07:54,640
That's terrible.

159
00:07:54,642 --> 00:07:55,892
We should do something.

160
00:07:55,894 --> 00:07:58,094
- Like what?
- I don't know.

161
00:07:58,096 --> 00:08:01,314
Try and talk to him, I guess,
see if he needs help.

162
00:08:01,316 --> 00:08:03,099
It's been six months
since he left.

163
00:08:03,101 --> 00:08:04,374
(Van Pelt) Maybe he's changed.
- No.

164
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:04,919
But--

165
00:08:04,944 --> 00:08:06,937
I offered him
all the help in the world,

166
00:08:06,938 --> 00:08:08,988
and he turned me down
many times.

167
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,506
He has to want to change.

168
00:08:10,508 --> 00:08:12,191
He has to hit bottom
and know it.

169
00:08:12,193 --> 00:08:14,076
That's recovery 101, right?

170
00:08:14,078 --> 00:08:15,778
I guess.

171
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,829
Well, maybe this is bottom.

172
00:08:16,831 --> 00:08:17,863
It's pretty low, boss.

173
00:08:17,865 --> 00:08:19,415
When he wants help,
he'll ask us.

174
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:21,250
He knows where we are.

175
00:08:21,252 --> 00:08:23,236
Hey, Pat. Good seeing ya.

176
00:08:23,238 --> 00:08:25,237
Get our John Doe here

177
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:27,873

(Keys jangle,
people speaking indistinctly)

179
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:47,426
Sign that. (Sighs)

180
00:08:47,428 --> 00:08:48,811
(Sighs)

181
00:08:48,813 --> 00:08:52,481
Uh, wh-why am I being released?
I didn't raise bail.

182
00:08:52,483 --> 00:08:54,200
Somebody raised it for you.

183
00:08:54,202 --> 00:08:56,235
Who was that?

184
00:08:56,237 --> 00:08:58,487
I don't have
that information.

185
00:08:58,489 --> 00:09:01,874
Teresa Lisbon is my guess.
Huh? Lisbon?

186
00:09:01,876 --> 00:09:04,276
I don't have
that information.

187
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:05,661
Okay. You don't have
that information.

188
00:09:05,663 --> 00:09:07,830
You can keep that.
Thank you.

189
00:09:07,832 --> 00:09:10,166
(Sniffles)

190
00:09:10,168 --> 00:09:12,385
(Sighs)

191
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:19,058
(Horn honks)
Oy.

192
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,726
(Hydraulics hiss)

193
00:09:23,513 --> 00:09:25,381

194
00:09:47,037 --> 00:09:49,705

(Blinds rattle)

198
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,281
Boss? Good news, bad news.
(Sighs)

199
00:10:15,283 --> 00:10:17,316
Bad news--
our John Doe's prints

200
00:10:17,318 --> 00:10:19,702
didn't get a match,
so we still have no I.D.

201
00:10:19,704 --> 00:10:20,786
Of course.

202
00:10:20,788 --> 00:10:22,738
Good news--
SAC P.D. caught a homicide

203
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,457
on Pacoima and Third
last night.

204
00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:26,542
Suspect got away,
but they have an eyewitness,

205
00:10:26,544 --> 00:10:28,494
and they recovered
the murder weapon--

206
00:10:28,496 --> 00:10:30,195
a sawed-off shotgun.

207
00:10:30,197 --> 00:10:32,131
Ejected cartridge was
the same make as ours,

208
00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:33,833
and Pacoima and Third is
only ten blocks

209
00:10:33,835 --> 00:10:35,167
from our murder scene.

210
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:36,135
That's news.

211
00:10:36,137 --> 00:10:38,554
Good news would be better
than that.

212
00:10:38,556 --> 00:10:39,872
It's a lead. (Sighs)

213
00:10:39,874 --> 00:10:41,307
You're right.
SAC P.D., you said?

214
00:10:41,309 --> 00:10:43,059
Uh, who's the detective
on that?

215
00:10:43,061 --> 00:10:46,011
Not sure. Somebody on
Captain Rupert's night shift.

216
00:10:46,013 --> 00:10:47,480
You're right.
It's a good lead,

217
00:10:47,482 --> 00:10:48,814
and I need to get
out of here.

218
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:51,183
Let's go down in person
and see what they have.

219
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,987
(Sighs)

220
00:10:54,989 --> 00:10:57,440
(Knock on door)

221
00:11:01,595 --> 00:11:03,228
(Inhales deeply)

222
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,397
Uh...

223
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:08,033
Mm. (Sighs)

224
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:11,570
Hey.

225
00:11:11,572 --> 00:11:12,955
Hey.

226
00:11:12,957 --> 00:11:15,174
Surprise.

227
00:11:15,176 --> 00:11:17,409
Yeah.

228
00:11:17,411 --> 00:11:18,928
Lorrie, right?

229
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:20,930
Lorelei.

230
00:11:20,932 --> 00:11:23,132
Sorry. This was a mistake.

231
00:11:23,134 --> 00:11:24,266
No, no, no, no, no.
Lorelei.

232
00:11:24,268 --> 00:11:25,851
I'm very happy to see you.

233
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:27,887
Just, uh, been
a little slow today.

234
00:11:27,889 --> 00:11:30,222
It's--it's been
a rough week. (Chuckles)

235
00:11:30,224 --> 00:11:32,892
Yeah, I can imagine.

236
00:11:32,894 --> 00:11:36,195
I brought you
some chicken soup.

237
00:11:36,197 --> 00:11:37,313
For me?

238
00:11:37,315 --> 00:11:38,814
Yeah.

239
00:11:38,816 --> 00:11:40,783
Come in.

240
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:45,270
Excuse the mess.

241
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,873
How did you know
my address?

242
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:50,159
The bail bondsman gave it
to me.

243
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:53,278
How did you know
who the bail bondsman was?

244
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,630
(Chuckles) Oh.

245
00:11:54,632 --> 00:11:57,249
What are you, Columbo here
with the third degree? (Chuckles)

246
00:11:57,251 --> 00:12:00,085
I'm sorry.
Just a little curious.

247
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:05,307
I knew who he was
because I was the one

248
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:07,125
that put up the money
for your bail.

249
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:09,845
That's a lot of money.

250
00:12:09,847 --> 00:12:12,481
I'll--I'll pay you back
as soon as I can.

251
00:12:12,483 --> 00:12:14,266
Figured you were good
for it.

252
00:12:14,268 --> 00:12:16,652
Why'd you do that for me?

253
00:12:16,654 --> 00:12:18,154
(Inhales deeply)

254
00:12:18,156 --> 00:12:21,407
You seemed like a good man
who lost his way.

255
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:23,475
I could help, so I did...

256
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:25,694
and at this point,

257
00:12:25,696 --> 00:12:28,064
a straight up "thank you"
would be okay.

258
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:30,950
Thank you.

259
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:35,921
There's, uh, a lot
of good men out there...

260
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:36,922
(Opens lid)

261
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:38,707
(Lid clatters)
who have lost their way.

262
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:41,794
Wow. You're gonna make me
say it out loud?

263
00:12:41,796 --> 00:12:42,711
(Chuckles)

264
00:12:42,713 --> 00:12:46,098
I felt like we got along
pretty good.

265
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,718
I felt like there was
some kind of...

266
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,771
weird connection there
between us.

267
00:12:51,773 --> 00:12:53,906
I trusted my feelings.

268
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:59,979
Damn it. Was I wrong?

269
00:12:59,981 --> 00:13:03,249
No.

270
00:13:03,251 --> 00:13:05,184
You weren't wrong.

271
00:13:05,186 --> 00:13:06,852
Okay then.

272
00:13:06,854 --> 00:13:09,572
I have to warn you,
Lorelei, um,

273
00:13:09,574 --> 00:13:14,076
I'm not the great catch
you might think I am from...

274
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:15,945
first impressions.

275
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:21,000
That's okay. Neither am I.

276
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:29,058
Bean, tell these people
what you saw.

277
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,676
I'm collecting cans on Third,

278
00:13:30,678 --> 00:13:33,095
right next to the park
where they sell their drugs.

279
00:13:33,097 --> 00:13:35,314
There's a gunshot. Boom!

280
00:13:35,316 --> 00:13:36,849
Then a tall, young,
Latin gentleman

281
00:13:36,851 --> 00:13:40,319
come running out of the park
holding a sawed-off shotgun.

282
00:13:40,321 --> 00:13:42,738
He trips and falls over.
(Chuckles)

283
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:46,025
Drops the gun.
Then he gets up and runs away,

284
00:13:46,027 --> 00:13:48,861
leaves the gun,
and that's what I saw.

285
00:13:48,863 --> 00:13:50,746
The tall,
young, Latin gentleman--

286
00:13:50,748 --> 00:13:52,364
did you get a good look
at him?

287
00:13:52,366 --> 00:13:53,866
Come right by me.

288
00:13:53,868 --> 00:13:56,035
Got a scar on his face
right here,

289
00:13:56,037 --> 00:13:57,620
little chin beard...
Mm-hmm.

290
00:13:57,622 --> 00:14:00,172
Big gold earring
like a pirate,

291
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:03,542
black T-shirt, jeans...
(Scoffs) White shoes.

292
00:14:03,544 --> 00:14:06,912
Anything on the T-shirt?
Logo? Numbers?

293
00:14:06,914 --> 00:14:08,097
Don't think so.

294
00:14:08,099 --> 00:14:09,081
Thanks, Bean.

295
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:12,768
Wait. Close your eyes
and picture him.

296
00:14:13,803 --> 00:14:17,422
Now imagine him coming
toward you.

297
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:19,358
Oh!

298
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,094
There's a little dog
right here on his shirt.

299
00:14:22,096 --> 00:14:24,980
Not a cute dog.
Like, you know...

300
00:14:24,982 --> 00:14:27,233
(Deep voice)
a snarling dog.

301
00:14:27,235 --> 00:14:28,767
Like a bulldog or a wolf?

302
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:29,785
Wolf!

303
00:14:29,787 --> 00:14:31,820
Grape Street Lobos wear
black shirts

304
00:14:31,822 --> 00:14:33,072
with a wolf on 'em.

305
00:14:33,074 --> 00:14:35,241
Thank you, Miss Bean.
Mm-hmm.

306
00:14:35,243 --> 00:14:37,793
Yeah, so it's kind of thin,
but my guys'll check out

307
00:14:37,795 --> 00:14:39,545
the Lobos,
and we'll let you know.

308
00:14:39,547 --> 00:14:41,413
Well, we can check 'em out
for you, if you'd like.

309
00:14:41,415 --> 00:14:43,048
CBI gang unit has
a really good database.

310
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:44,616
That's okay, girls.

311
00:14:44,618 --> 00:14:46,085
Thanks, but we don't even know
if it's the same gun as yours.

312
00:14:46,087 --> 00:14:47,336
It probably isn't.

313
00:14:47,338 --> 00:14:49,121
Yeah, okay, Rupe.
It was good seeing ya.

314
00:14:49,123 --> 00:14:50,956
Yeah.

315
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,725
Talk to the gang unit.

316
00:14:52,727 --> 00:14:54,643
See what they know
about the Lobos.

317
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:55,644
Okay.

318
00:14:55,646 --> 00:14:56,812
I'm gonna take
some personal time.

319
00:14:56,814 --> 00:14:58,964
You take the car.
I'm gonna walk.

320
00:14:58,966 --> 00:14:59,965
Walk?

321
00:14:59,967 --> 00:15:02,351

I mean... okay.

322
00:15:02,353 --> 00:15:04,303

00:17:12,817 --> 00:17:13,899
None at all.

358
00:17:13,901 --> 00:17:16,735
(Cup clatters)
It's very restful.

359
00:17:16,737 --> 00:17:18,203
I don't follow you.

360
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:21,490
I do what Red John
tells me to do.

361
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,244
(Lowered voice) What?

362
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:28,881
Your freedom,
our night together--

363
00:17:28,883 --> 00:17:31,383
that was a gift from him.

364
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,921
You can hurt me,
if you'd like.

365
00:17:37,006 --> 00:17:39,558
No, I don't want
to hurt you.

366
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,928
I've given up.
He knows that.

367
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:44,296
What does he want from me?

368
00:17:44,298 --> 00:17:47,149
He doesn't want anything
from you.

369
00:17:47,151 --> 00:17:49,818
After all these years,
he's come to see you

370
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:54,273
as an old comrade
rather than an enemy.

371
00:17:54,275 --> 00:17:56,658
He hopes you'll come to feel
the same way.

372
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,411
A comrade.

373
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:02,164
Patrick...

374
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,049
look at yourself.

375
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:07,369
You need a new life.

376
00:18:07,371 --> 00:18:09,338
He can give that to you.

377
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,757
You have to leave.

378
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:13,592
He's offering the hand
of friendship.

379
00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:15,994
If you refuse him,
he'll be upset.

380
00:18:15,996 --> 00:18:16,995
Anyone would be.

381
00:18:16,997 --> 00:18:18,547
Get out.

382
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:23,135
(Sighs)

383
00:18:24,721 --> 00:18:27,222
You know where to find me.

384
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:35,575
(Breathing heavily)

385
00:18:47,325 --> 00:18:51,295
(Indistinct conversations)

386
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,046
Hey, Grace, you seen Lisbon?

387
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:55,615
She had to take
some personal time.

388
00:18:55,617 --> 00:18:57,868
- Where'd she go?
- Didn't say.

389
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,503
We have a lead.

390
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:01,338
I just got this
from the gang unit.

391
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,974
Kevin Cintron,
A.K.A. Purple,

392
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:07,010
affiliated with
the Grape Street Lobos.

393
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:08,896
Matches the witness description
exactly.

394
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:10,397
Did you show the witness
the photo?

395
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:12,149
I do that, and we have to go
through SAC P.D. homicide,

396
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,634
and they'll want to take
the bust, and we need the bust.

397
00:19:14,636 --> 00:19:15,652
Must be a thousand bad guys

398
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,237
with gold earrings, beards,
and scars.

399
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,772
I got an address
from his P.O.

400
00:19:18,774 --> 00:19:20,023
Well, after killing
two people,

401
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:21,692
that's probably not
where he's at.

402
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:24,194
It's a good place to start,
though, and I'm going.

403
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:26,580
You want me to get you
some doughnuts while I'm out?

404
00:19:28,649 --> 00:19:32,236
(Bell tolling)

405
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:56,260
(Inhales deeply and sighs)

406
00:20:02,617 --> 00:20:04,318
(Nasal voice) This is God.
(Gasps)

407
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,404
What is it now? (Laughing)

408
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:10,490
You scared the life out
of me. (Sighs)

409
00:20:10,492 --> 00:20:12,626
(Normal voice) I crawled all
the way on my hands and knees

410
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:15,862
from that door,
but it was worth it.

411
00:20:15,864 --> 00:20:16,964
What are you doing here?

412
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:18,915
It's good to see you.
How have you been?

413
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:20,467
(Lowered voice)
Worried sick is how I've been,

414
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,803
and then you pop in here
like some sort of a lunatic,

415
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:24,638
playing games,
asking me how I've been.

416
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,206
- Just...
- Shame on you.

417
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:27,557
stay calm, okay?

418
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,225
It's important that
no one sees us together.

419
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,378
(Sighs)

420
00:20:30,379 --> 00:20:31,812
Why not?

421
00:20:33,381 --> 00:20:35,649
I'm faking my breakdown.

422
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:38,185
It's a ruse to trap
Red John.

423
00:20:38,187 --> 00:20:40,687
You son of a bitch.

424
00:20:40,689 --> 00:20:43,240
You son of a bitch.

425
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,658
Okay, we are in a church.

426
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,893
Uh, wait, so how does
faking a breakdown--

427
00:20:46,895 --> 00:20:48,945
if that's what you're
<i>really</i> doing,

428
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:50,330
because it looks
pretty real to me,

429
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,232
how does that trap
Red John?

430
00:20:52,234 --> 00:20:54,501
What does Red John want
from me?

431
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:57,537
What did he send
that little girl to ask me?

432
00:20:57,539 --> 00:20:58,738
Do you give up?

433
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,173
Exactly, and I do give up.

434
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:02,459
I quit.
I burn the Red John files.

435
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:04,961
I freak out at the boss.
I admit defeat,

436
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:08,382
and I sink
into a terrible depression.

437
00:21:08,384 --> 00:21:11,184
Brilliant. You did
that part great. Now what?

438
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:13,437
And why doesn't he just
kill me?

439
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:15,939
Because it's too easy.
He wants to turn me.

440
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,608
He wants to make me
his disciple.

441
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:22,195
So I admit defeat,
and then he reaches out

442
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:23,430
to start a conversation.

443
00:21:23,432 --> 00:21:25,482
(Sighs) Well,
that's all supposition.

444
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:27,534
- He's not gonna--
- He already has reached out.

445
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:30,787
He sent me a message.

446
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:36,109
I need to start a new life,
and he can help me.

447
00:21:36,111 --> 00:21:39,963
Help you?
He wants to help you?

448
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,381
- Yeah.
- What are you gonna do?

449
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:44,718
Well, I'm gonna take him up
on the offer.

450
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,969
I'm in a lot
of real trouble.

451
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,004
(Sighs)
I do need a new life.

452
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:49,756
Yes, you do.

453
00:21:49,758 --> 00:21:52,792
That's what makes
the gag work.

454
00:21:52,794 --> 00:21:53,810
Then what?

455
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,479
Well, I don't know.
I let him lead.

456
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:57,180
That's the beauty of it.

457
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:59,516
He thinks I'm the fish
and he's the fisherman.

458
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:02,269
Unless he sees the truth.

459
00:22:02,271 --> 00:22:04,771
I am giving him
his heart's desire.

460
00:22:04,773 --> 00:22:07,640
He will see
what he wants to see.

461
00:22:07,642 --> 00:22:09,276
Or not.

462
00:22:09,278 --> 00:22:11,144
Fooled you. I can fool him.

463
00:22:11,146 --> 00:22:13,663
Yeah, you fooled me
all right. Well done.

464
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:16,032
Yeah. Well...

465
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:18,485
I'm sorry.

466
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:20,921
I tried calling.

467
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:23,823
I tried calling you
hundreds of times,

468
00:22:23,825 --> 00:22:27,427
begging you to talk to me,
begging you to get help.

469
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:32,499
(Voice breaks) Not a reply.
Not a word. Not a text.

470
00:22:32,501 --> 00:22:34,667
Sorry.

471
00:22:34,669 --> 00:22:36,603
You know what?

472
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,638
I have not been sleeping.
I've been--

473
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,143
forget it. Never mind.
Y-you know, you're a jerk.

474
00:22:44,979 --> 00:22:49,282
And your plan? It's stupid.
It's not even a plan.

475
00:22:50,151 --> 00:22:53,120
But you will help me?

476
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:56,656
What am I supposed to say, no?
God, you're despicable.

477
00:22:56,658 --> 00:22:58,208
(Sighs)

478
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,360
Take this. It's clean.

479
00:23:00,362 --> 00:23:01,528
I'll call you on it
when the time comes.

480
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,413
In the meantime,
do not contact me.

481
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:06,366
Do not let anyone
from CBI contact me,

482
00:23:06,368 --> 00:23:09,002
and don't tell anyone
the truth.

483
00:23:09,004 --> 00:23:11,004
Not a soul.

484
00:23:11,006 --> 00:23:12,055
I cannot believe

485
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,473
you didn't tell me
you were doing this,

486
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,592
that you couldn't trust me
with a secret like that.

487
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:17,260
We're supposed to be
partners.

488
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:19,229
God knows,
I am happy you're back.

489
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,680
It is a huge relief,

490
00:23:20,682 --> 00:23:24,684
but what you did,
frankly, was a betrayal.

491
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:28,989
God, I hate you, Jane.

492
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:30,690
I hate you!

493
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:38,198
We have your prints
on the shotgun, Kevin.

494
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,282
We have an eyewitness
who saw you

495
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:42,118
shoot Dashawn Willits
with that shotgun.

496
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,670
I'm showing them the gun
because I'm trying

497
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:44,788
to sell it to 'em.

498
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,039
Fool tried to take the gun
from me.

499
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:47,340
I had no other choice.

500
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:48,341
But the first shooting,
though,

501
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:49,843
the white John Doe
on Lincoln Avenue,

502
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,845
did that guy try to steal
your gun, too?

503
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:54,631
I didn't touch that man,
all right? He killed himself.

504
00:23:55,766 --> 00:23:58,585
I swear to God.
Me and my boy Manfredo,

505
00:23:58,587 --> 00:23:59,886
we cruisin' down
the alleyway.

506
00:23:59,888 --> 00:24:01,938
We lookin' for open windows,
to be honest with you,

507
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,424
see this guy sittin' up
against the wall,

508
00:24:04,426 --> 00:24:07,260
got a bicycle next to him
and a sawed-off shotgun.

509
00:24:07,262 --> 00:24:09,446
Just as we start
to get close... (Chuckles)

510
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,064
Damn if he don't blow off
his head.

511
00:24:11,066 --> 00:24:13,450
Hara-kiri.
No messing around.

512
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:14,901
How do we know
you're telling the truth?

513
00:24:14,903 --> 00:24:17,770
You don't.
You just know what is.

514
00:24:17,772 --> 00:24:20,240
(Chuckles) Come on, man,
you guys ask Manfredo,

515
00:24:20,242 --> 00:24:21,908
he gonna tell you
the same thing.

516
00:24:23,578 --> 00:24:25,962
Yeah.
Man just shot himself.

517
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,998
Boom! Freaked me out.

518
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,716
I wanted the gun,
but Kevin took it.

519
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:32,168
I got the bike.
Sweet fixie.

520
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,453
Where's the bike, Manfredo?

521
00:24:33,455 --> 00:24:34,787
Got stolen.

522
00:24:34,789 --> 00:24:36,306
(Sighs)

523
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,391
I know. Ironic, right?

524
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:40,343
Did you take anything else
from him?

525
00:24:40,345 --> 00:24:43,013
<i>We looked.</i>
<i>He had nothing on him.</i>

526
00:24:43,797 --> 00:24:45,482
I think he's telling
the truth.

527
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,067
Cintron admitted
to the second killing,

528
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:48,001
no problem.

529
00:24:48,003 --> 00:24:49,536
Why would he lie about
this one?

530
00:24:49,538 --> 00:24:52,405
Looks like we'll never know
who he was. Poor soul.

531
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:53,473
Mm.
(Door opens)

532
00:24:53,475 --> 00:24:54,474
Lisbon, a word?

533
00:24:54,476 --> 00:24:56,276
Yeah.

534
00:24:56,278 --> 00:24:58,978
Uh, is that the John Doe case
you're working on?

535
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:01,248
Yes, sir. It looks to be
a suicide. (Sighs)

536
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,416
Oh, good. Excellent.
Get that off the books, eh?

537
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:04,701
Um...
(Snaps fingers)

538
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:06,419
I wanted to talk
to you about Jane.

539
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:08,038
It's been six months
since he's gone.

540
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,673
I think it's time
for a little outreach.

541
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:11,875
Mm?
Well, it's the humane thing to do.

542
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:13,826
He was a big part
of the CBI family, after all.

543
00:25:13,828 --> 00:25:15,095
I suppose, but I--

544
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:17,764
I just--I-I just want
to give him a call, see if,

545
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,382
you know, I can't
persuade him into rehab

546
00:25:19,384 --> 00:25:21,134
or a psychiatry program
or some such.

547
00:25:21,136 --> 00:25:22,185
You know, it could make
a big difference

548
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,436
in his sentencing.

549
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:25,055
He could get
community service.

550
00:25:25,057 --> 00:25:27,641
He could come back
and work for us eventually.

551
00:25:27,643 --> 00:25:31,144
God knows, we need him,
closure rates being

552
00:25:31,146 --> 00:25:33,229
what they are right now--
low.

553
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:35,565
Yes, sir, and we will do
our best to fix that,

554
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:37,850
but I don't think
we can help Jane.

555
00:25:37,852 --> 00:25:40,070
Besides, y--
he's made his bed.

556
00:25:40,072 --> 00:25:42,989
I don't think I could work
with him again.

557
00:25:42,991 --> 00:25:45,041
I need someone
I can rely on.

558
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,960
I'm surprised.

559
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:49,028
I thought you would want
to help him.

560
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:51,414
Well, I do.

561
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:52,699
It's not how it looks.

562
00:25:52,701 --> 00:25:55,201
I just have a feeling
Jane's better off

563
00:25:55,203 --> 00:25:56,419
left alone right now.

564
00:25:56,421 --> 00:25:59,205
Okay.
It was just a thought.

565
00:26:01,592 --> 00:26:04,644
(Exhales deeply) Mm.

566
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:08,398
I've been, um,
I've been thinking about

567
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,066
what you said
about your friend.

568
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,002
Yes.

569
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:15,822
You said that he could
help me start a new life.

570
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,824
Mm-hmm.

571
00:26:19,059 --> 00:26:21,995
What does that mean
exactly?

572
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:25,415
A new identity. Money.

573
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,917
A place to live.
A job, if you want one.

574
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,537
And I-I do what
in exchange?

575
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:32,238
Accept his friendship.

576
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,174
It's that easy?

577
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:35,759
Sure.

578
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:38,111
Uh, he'll want to speak
to you first,

579
00:26:38,113 --> 00:26:40,447
make sure you're on the level,
if that's all right.

580
00:26:40,449 --> 00:26:42,782
Yeah.

581
00:26:42,784 --> 00:26:44,918
And you'll need
to bring him a gift

582
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:48,555
to show your respect
for him.

583
00:26:48,557 --> 00:26:50,190
What kind of gift?

584
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:55,311
Well, Teresa Lisbon's dead body
would be the perfect thing.

585
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:59,115
(Laughs)

586
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:01,685
That's absurd.

587
00:27:08,175 --> 00:27:10,710
What did you tell me?

588
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:13,580
There is no right or wrong.

589
00:27:13,582 --> 00:27:15,799
There's just stuff
that happens.

590
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:19,669
No, no. There--there--
there has to be something else.

591
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:20,920
(Sighs)

592
00:27:20,922 --> 00:27:23,423
I can't think of anything else
that would please him.

593
00:27:23,425 --> 00:27:26,059
I can't do that.

594
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:29,796
I understand
you're not there yet,

595
00:27:29,798 --> 00:27:32,916
but look at it
from his point of view.

596
00:27:34,051 --> 00:27:36,152
How else will he know
you've truly had

597
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,871
a change of heart?

598
00:27:46,647 --> 00:27:47,980
(Elevator bell dings)

599
00:27:47,982 --> 00:27:50,333
Jane.

600
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,334
Not now.

601
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:54,003
Uh, I'm glad to see that...

602
00:28:04,465 --> 00:28:06,833
(Van Pelt) Jane.

603
00:28:08,769 --> 00:28:10,470
Jane.

604
00:28:10,472 --> 00:28:13,807
Well, it's good to see you all.

605
00:28:14,942 --> 00:28:16,008
How are you?

606
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:18,027
Uh, we're good.
How are you?

607
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:21,147
Never better. Never better.

608
00:28:21,149 --> 00:28:22,949
Jane?

609
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,818
There you are.

610
00:28:35,663 --> 00:28:39,833
(Panting)
Good luck, Teresa.

611
00:28:39,835 --> 00:28:41,367
(Cocks gun)

612
00:28:41,369 --> 00:28:43,470
Love you.

613
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:45,379
(Gunshots)

614
00:29:09,888 --> 00:29:13,140
(Panting) What happened?

615
00:29:16,227 --> 00:29:18,479
Patrick Jane.

616
00:29:18,481 --> 00:29:20,264
He took Lisbon.

617
00:29:20,266 --> 00:29:24,318
Is he--ohh.
(Whispers) Ohh.

618
00:29:26,021 --> 00:29:28,355
(Voice breaks) Wh-who--
who is th--who is that?

619
00:29:28,357 --> 00:29:32,159
(Panting) It's Rigsby.

620
00:29:32,161 --> 00:29:35,079
It's Wayne Rigsby.

621
00:29:35,081 --> 00:29:37,331
(Police radio chatter)

622
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:39,083
Ohh.

623
00:29:39,085 --> 00:29:40,451
(Indistinct conversations)

624
00:29:40,453 --> 00:29:41,785
Turn it up.

625
00:29:41,787 --> 00:29:43,287
(Tray clatters)

626
00:29:44,572 --> 00:29:48,509
<i>...in a macabre twist,</i>
<i>after killing Agent Rigsby,</i>

627
00:29:48,511 --> 00:29:50,311
<i>34-year-old father</i>
<i>of a baby boy,</i>

628
00:29:50,313 --> 00:29:53,881
<i>the suspect, Patrick Jane,</i>
<i>took Agent Teresa Lisbon,</i>

629
00:29:53,883 --> 00:29:56,684

<i>away with him when he escaped.</i>

630
00:29:56,686 --> 00:29:58,218
Authorities will not speculate

631
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,721
<i>as to why he wants</i>
<i>her dead body.</i>

632
00:30:06,094 --> 00:30:09,596
Ohh. I'm hungry. I'm going
to the store for nachos.

633
00:30:09,598 --> 00:30:12,199
You guys want anything?
They got pizza, hot dogs.

634
00:30:12,201 --> 00:30:13,450
I'm good.

635
00:30:13,452 --> 00:30:15,569
Me, too. Uh, Rigsby--

636
00:30:15,571 --> 00:30:19,289
Yeah, I know, I know.
Don't call Sarah. I know.

637
00:30:19,291 --> 00:30:21,625
It's killing me, though. (Sighs)
She must be freaking out.

638
00:30:21,627 --> 00:30:22,993
Well, look
at the bright side.

639
00:30:22,995 --> 00:30:24,161
Think of how happy
she's gonna be

640
00:30:24,163 --> 00:30:25,779
when you come back to life.

641
00:30:25,781 --> 00:30:27,665
Huh. (Sighs)

642
00:30:27,667 --> 00:30:31,502
(Latches click)

643
00:30:32,587 --> 00:30:34,755
So where'd you find
this place?

644
00:30:34,757 --> 00:30:37,925
The owner owes me poker money
he'll never pay back.

645
00:30:37,927 --> 00:30:40,427
Oh.

646
00:30:40,429 --> 00:30:43,814
So that thing you said
before you shot me--

647
00:30:43,816 --> 00:30:46,316
uh, what did you mean?

648
00:30:49,187 --> 00:30:51,188
What did I say?

649
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:53,440
I was kinda hyped up.

650
00:30:53,442 --> 00:30:54,658
Oh, boy. Me, too.

651
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,944
I thought at any moment
we were gonna get found out.

652
00:30:56,946 --> 00:30:58,696
Mm.
(Cell phone rings)

653
00:30:59,531 --> 00:31:02,315
It's her.

654
00:31:02,317 --> 00:31:03,450
Hello?

655
00:31:03,452 --> 00:31:06,704
Spoke to my friend.
He wants to meet with you.

656
00:31:06,706 --> 00:31:12,543
2369 Foxglove Parkway,
southwest Las Vegas.

657
00:31:12,545 --> 00:31:16,130
Go there at 3:00 today
and wait for instructions.

658
00:31:16,132 --> 00:31:19,850
2369 Foxglove Parkway
at 3:00.

659
00:31:19,852 --> 00:31:21,334
Don't forget the gift.

660
00:31:21,336 --> 00:31:22,886
I have it right here.

661
00:31:22,888 --> 00:31:25,889
Don't bring the whole thing.
Just the head.

662
00:31:28,176 --> 00:31:29,893
Okay.

663
00:31:29,895 --> 00:31:32,312
(Inhales deeply)
(Snaps shut)

664
00:31:32,314 --> 00:31:33,480
(Taps phone)

665
00:31:33,482 --> 00:31:35,733
So you want the good news
or the bad news first?

666
00:31:35,735 --> 00:31:39,820
You lost two fine agents.
I'm sorry.

667
00:31:39,822 --> 00:31:41,121
Thank you.

668
00:31:41,123 --> 00:31:42,456
I knew Jane was wrong
somehow,

669
00:31:42,458 --> 00:31:44,491
but I certainly never
expected this.

670
00:31:44,493 --> 00:31:46,660
Well, nobody did.

671
00:31:46,662 --> 00:31:50,363
We received no evaluation that
indicated danger of this sort.

672
00:31:50,365 --> 00:31:52,666
CBI is in no way liable.

673
00:31:52,668 --> 00:31:54,668
Hmm.

674
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:57,171
Well, the question remains,
why did Jane do this?

675
00:31:57,173 --> 00:32:00,340
Orders from Red John?

676
00:32:00,342 --> 00:32:03,260
If so, why now? Why Lisbon?

677
00:32:03,262 --> 00:32:04,344
I was talking with Lisbon.

678
00:32:04,346 --> 00:32:06,546
I suggested we reach out
to try and help Jane

679
00:32:06,548 --> 00:32:10,383
because he was in trouble,
and she said "no" very firmly.

680
00:32:10,385 --> 00:32:12,186
She said,
"it's not how it looks."

681
00:32:12,188 --> 00:32:14,071
Meaning what?

682
00:32:14,073 --> 00:32:18,325
I don't know.
I don't know what to think.

683
00:32:18,327 --> 00:32:19,409
(Van Pelt) Pretty much
the whole neighborhood is

684
00:32:19,411 --> 00:32:20,744
in foreclosure.

685
00:32:20,746 --> 00:32:23,230
There's hardly anyone there.
It's like a ghost town.

686
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:24,414
Smart move by Red John.

687
00:32:24,416 --> 00:32:27,034
Tough to set up any kind
of surveillance in advance.

688
00:32:27,036 --> 00:32:28,168
Any movement's gonna be
conspicuous.

689
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:29,903
He must be suspicious.

690
00:32:29,905 --> 00:32:32,673
No, he's just cautious.

691
00:32:32,675 --> 00:32:34,792
And he's hooked. He believes.

692
00:32:34,794 --> 00:32:36,760
How can you be sure?

693
00:32:36,762 --> 00:32:38,996
Because he wants to believe.

694
00:32:40,431 --> 00:32:42,883
We're doing this thing,
so let's just do it.

695
00:32:42,885 --> 00:32:44,968
Is everybody clear on the plan?
We're gonna move soon.

696
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:46,019
(Rigsby) Yeah.

697
00:32:46,021 --> 00:32:49,223
Hey, you guys, listen,
I want to apologize

698
00:32:49,225 --> 00:32:50,190
for deceiving you...

699
00:32:50,192 --> 00:32:52,142
(Scoffs) Whatever.

700
00:32:52,144 --> 00:32:54,427
And thank you
for helping me now.

701
00:32:54,429 --> 00:32:55,612
We're helping the boss.

702
00:32:55,614 --> 00:32:57,397
Yeah. She's helping you.
We're helping her.

703
00:32:57,399 --> 00:32:59,432
Guys, cut him some slack.

704
00:32:59,434 --> 00:33:02,236
Oh. Yay, team.

705
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,552
A 12. Rigsby, W.

706
00:33:18,554 --> 00:33:22,622
(Drawer rattles)

707
00:33:26,961 --> 00:33:27,928
No face.

708
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:29,096
Right.

709
00:33:29,098 --> 00:33:30,180
Could be anybody.

710
00:33:30,182 --> 00:33:33,267
Well, it says "Rigsby" here.
No mistake.

711
00:33:36,988 --> 00:33:38,238
Do you have a tape measure?

712
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,240
Sure.

713
00:33:41,976 --> 00:33:45,779
Bill, I need you to find out
A.S.A.P.

714
00:33:45,781 --> 00:33:48,481
where Kimball Cho
and Grace Van Pelt are located.

715
00:33:48,483 --> 00:33:50,984
Yeah, right now.
Hold on one second.

716
00:33:50,986 --> 00:33:53,370
Put that at the top
of his head.

717
00:33:56,674 --> 00:33:58,158
5'11".

718
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:01,595
This isn't Wayne Rigsby.

719
00:34:01,597 --> 00:34:04,164
Yeah. Find out where they are.

720
00:34:04,166 --> 00:34:05,465
Thanks. And, Bill?

721
00:34:05,467 --> 00:34:07,634
I want arrest warrants prepped
for every single member

722
00:34:07,636 --> 00:34:10,371
of that CBI team,
dead or alive.

723
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,314
(Turns off engine)

724
00:34:45,862 --> 00:34:48,280
Mm.

725
00:34:48,282 --> 00:34:50,999
The game begins.

726
00:35:01,383 --> 00:35:02,917
(Patrick) Hey, Lisbon.

727
00:35:02,919 --> 00:35:04,836
Must have been a while since
you rode on the handlebars

728
00:35:04,838 --> 00:35:06,137
of a man's bike.

729
00:35:06,139 --> 00:35:07,538
Ha ha.

730
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,724
It's kind of romantic.

731
00:35:09,726 --> 00:35:11,392
Wind in your hair.

732
00:35:11,394 --> 00:35:14,729
You're a sick man.

733
00:35:14,731 --> 00:35:17,548
5-0-5-9.

734
00:35:18,884 --> 00:35:22,654
5-0-6-5. 5-0-6-5...

735
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:27,992
Uh, there is no 5-0-7-1.

736
00:35:27,994 --> 00:35:29,727
<i>(Gravel scrapes)</i>

737
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:32,897
There's nothing.
It's just desert.

738
00:35:32,899 --> 00:35:36,701
There's no one here.

739
00:35:36,703 --> 00:35:38,169
Hang on.

740
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:42,340
Long black limousine.

741
00:35:42,342 --> 00:35:45,626
We're moving in. We'll be
on the scene in three minutes.

742
00:35:45,628 --> 00:35:46,844
Stay healthy till then.

743
00:35:46,846 --> 00:35:48,046
Wait.

744
00:35:48,048 --> 00:35:50,048
Let's just be sure.

745
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:52,800
(Brakes squeal)

746
00:35:57,389 --> 00:35:59,774
Large man with a gun...

747
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:03,644
Red John's girl. This is it.

748
00:36:05,698 --> 00:36:07,699
All right, we're moving in.
(Starts engine, shifts gears)

749
00:36:07,701 --> 00:36:10,284
(Tires peal)

750
00:36:10,286 --> 00:36:12,570
(Tires screech)

751
00:36:12,572 --> 00:36:15,406
FBI. Turn off the car
and show me your hands.

752
00:36:15,408 --> 00:36:19,610
- FBI! Nobody move!
- CBI! Don't shoot! We're CBI agents!

753
00:36:19,612 --> 00:36:22,080
You're making a terrible mistake.
Get out.

754
00:36:22,082 --> 00:36:23,948
We're in the middle
of an operation.

755
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:25,083
(Grunts)

756
00:36:25,085 --> 00:36:26,134
(Man) FBI!

757
00:36:26,136 --> 00:36:27,451
Turn off the car
and show me your hands!

758
00:36:27,453 --> 00:36:30,138
- Hi.
- Hey.

759
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:32,256
That the gift?

760
00:36:32,258 --> 00:36:34,175
Red John in there?

761
00:36:34,177 --> 00:36:35,343
Mm-hmm.

762
00:36:35,345 --> 00:36:38,012
He's looking forward
to speaking with you.

763
00:36:39,815 --> 00:36:43,634
You know, Patrick,
there's a childish hopefulness

764
00:36:43,636 --> 00:36:46,721
about you that is
really quite adorable.

765
00:36:48,774 --> 00:36:50,324
Put it on the hood.

766
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:57,665
So what is it, a football?
A cabbage?

767
00:36:57,667 --> 00:37:02,754
Melon. Honeydew.

768
00:37:02,756 --> 00:37:03,955
Organic.

769
00:37:06,375 --> 00:37:09,544
Adorable.

770
00:37:09,546 --> 00:37:13,131
Frisk him, then beat him...
a little.

771
00:37:21,306 --> 00:37:24,192
(Clatters)
Uhh!

772
00:37:24,194 --> 00:37:25,860
Well, well, well.

773
00:37:25,862 --> 00:37:27,395
Agent, this is a mistake.
Agent Darcy, you don't understand.

774
00:37:27,397 --> 00:37:29,680
Please, listen to me.
No, I don't understand.

775
00:37:29,682 --> 00:37:32,183
You're supposed to be dead,
as are you.

776
00:37:32,185 --> 00:37:33,701
This is very strange.

777
00:37:33,703 --> 00:37:35,153
Susan, I am begging you.

778
00:37:35,155 --> 00:37:37,622
Please listen to what
I'm saying.

779
00:37:37,624 --> 00:37:41,542
Our fake deaths were a ruse
to trap Red John, and it worked.

780
00:37:41,544 --> 00:37:44,328
Jane is with him right now,
and his life is in grave danger.

781
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:46,697
He's at 5071 Keston Avenue.

782
00:37:46,699 --> 00:37:48,216
Uh-huh.

783
00:37:48,218 --> 00:37:50,534
(Grunts) That's enough.
We haven't got much time.

784
00:37:50,536 --> 00:37:52,653
Put him
in the passenger seat.

785
00:37:52,655 --> 00:37:56,040
(Grunting)

786
00:37:58,227 --> 00:38:00,461
(Continues grunting)

787
00:38:02,681 --> 00:38:06,050
(Breathing heavily)

788
00:38:06,052 --> 00:38:08,603
(Red John) Hello, Patrick.

789
00:38:17,229 --> 00:38:19,330
Hey.

790
00:38:19,332 --> 00:38:20,731
How you doing?

791
00:38:20,733 --> 00:38:23,584
Debonair at all costs, huh?

792
00:38:23,586 --> 00:38:25,703
When did you know?

793
00:38:25,705 --> 00:38:28,506
Oh, you strung me along
for a good long while.

794
00:38:28,508 --> 00:38:29,841
Well done.

795
00:38:29,843 --> 00:38:32,126
Luckily, I have a good friend
in the FBI,

796
00:38:32,128 --> 00:38:36,580
so I found out
when the FBI found out.

797
00:38:36,582 --> 00:38:38,799
Cat got your tongue?

798
00:38:38,801 --> 00:38:40,751
I have nothing to say.

799
00:38:40,753 --> 00:38:43,387
Really? Nothing?

800
00:38:43,389 --> 00:38:46,057
"Go to hell"
goes without saying,

801
00:38:46,059 --> 00:38:47,892
so, yes, nothing.

802
00:38:47,894 --> 00:38:52,930
As you well know, Patrick,
there is no hell.

803
00:38:52,932 --> 00:38:55,349
When I die, I won't be punished.

804
00:38:57,035 --> 00:39:00,371
What if you really did have
a change of heart?

805
00:39:00,373 --> 00:39:03,124
What if you and I were friends?

806
00:39:03,126 --> 00:39:06,410
Imagine the life we could lead.

807
00:39:06,412 --> 00:39:10,998
It's a higher path, Patrick.

808
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,801
A nobler existence.

809
00:39:13,803 --> 00:39:15,887
Like I said, go to hell.

810
00:39:15,889 --> 00:39:18,472
Oh, well, as you wish.

811
00:39:18,474 --> 00:39:20,691
Lorelei, cut off
two of his fingers.

812
00:39:20,693 --> 00:39:23,361
You choose which.
Then we should go.

813
00:39:26,598 --> 00:39:31,936
(Grunting)

814
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:35,973
Aah!

815
00:39:35,975 --> 00:39:36,991
I'm sorry.

816
00:39:36,993 --> 00:39:39,527
Aah! Aah!

817
00:39:39,529 --> 00:39:41,979
(Siren whoops)
Aah!

818
00:39:52,207 --> 00:39:55,042
(Siren wailing)

819
00:39:55,044 --> 00:39:56,594
(Tires screech)

820
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,488
FBI! Turn off the vehicle!

821
00:40:26,959 --> 00:40:28,242
Let me see your hands!

822
00:40:28,244 --> 00:40:29,794
Get your hands up!

823
00:40:40,372 --> 00:40:42,223
<i>(Error tone chimes)</i>

824
00:40:42,225 --> 00:40:45,226
<i>(Female automated voice) This</i>
<i>call has been disconnected.</i>

825
00:40:45,228 --> 00:40:48,562

826
00:40:48,564 --> 00:40:50,181

827
00:41:01,893 --> 00:41:04,195
(Car doors close)

828
00:41:10,168 --> 00:41:11,502
You all right?

829
00:41:11,504 --> 00:41:13,838
Yeah, I'm fine.

830
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,423
Never better.

831
00:41:15,425 --> 00:41:18,626
(Siren wailing in distance)

832
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:37,395
I'm very happy
to meet you, Lorelei.

833
00:41:37,397 --> 00:41:39,596
We rarely get
the chance to talk

834
00:41:39,598 --> 00:41:42,450
to someone who knows
Red John so well.

835
00:41:42,452 --> 00:41:44,535
Good to meet you, too.

836
00:41:44,537 --> 00:41:46,354
Heard so much about you.

837
00:41:50,242 --> 00:41:53,244
We were lovers, him and me.

838
00:41:53,246 --> 00:41:55,496
Did he tell you that?

839
00:41:56,748 --> 00:41:57,798
No?

840
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,634
Why not, lover?

841
00:42:00,636 --> 00:42:03,754
Are you ashamed of me?

842
00:42:03,756 --> 00:42:07,174
Did we do something bad?

843
00:42:07,176 --> 00:42:09,293
I know it's hard
to believe now,

844
00:42:09,295 --> 00:42:12,763
but you're gonna talk to us.

845
00:42:12,765 --> 00:42:15,066
You're gonna break down,
and you're gonna tell us

846
00:42:15,068 --> 00:42:16,517
everything you know
about Red John.

847
00:42:16,519 --> 00:42:18,569
You're gonna sing
like a bird.

848
00:42:18,571 --> 00:42:21,355
No, lover.

849
00:42:21,357 --> 00:42:22,690
I won't.

850
00:42:22,692 --> 00:42:24,992
Yes, you will.

851
00:42:24,994 --> 00:42:26,026
(Kisses)

852
00:42:26,028 --> 00:42:28,562
(Whispers)
Yes, you will.

853
00:42:35,537 --> 00:42:37,204
